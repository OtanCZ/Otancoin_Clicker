### <img src="/images/hat.png" alt="Oťancoin" width="25" height="25"/>**Cryptocurrency crashed as a whole.** You now dedicate your life to mining *"Oťancoins"*.<img src="/images/hat.png" alt="Oťancoin" width="25" height="25"/>  


You may play [**HERE**](http://clicker.otan.cz). Although no idea why you would.  
If you played a previous "version" and are encountering weird bugs, try to delete your cookies and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.  
This was made for a school project: Making your own Clicker-type game.  


TODO list:
- [x] Make the layout.
- [x] Make the EPIC COMIC SANS logo + the coin.
- [x] Make it well, click.
- [x] Saving progress using cookies.
- [x] Making the shop and a way to buy stuff from it.
- [x] Getting brain damage.
- [ ] Make the game more pretty.
- [ ] Balancing out the shop.
- [ ] Providing pictures for the shop.
- [ ] Maybe some clicking upgrades, since it becomes redundant after a few minutes.
- [ ] Ascensions?
